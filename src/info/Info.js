I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything
that might not be obvious right off the bat :) I recommend looking at the template example live using "npm start" to get an idea
of what each of the values mean.

    bio: "Hello, I'm Aswin Pradeep. I'm currently in the data science domain with an edtech startup, working on the curriculum team. I'm also pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. I aim to transition into software engineering because I love problem-solving and building tech products, especially robust backend systems. I have expertise in DSA and use Java and Python for backend development. I'm passionate about system design (both LLD and HLD), and I enjoy learning, applying new concepts, and teaching coding online. I've built some cool projects that you can check out in the portfolio section.",
